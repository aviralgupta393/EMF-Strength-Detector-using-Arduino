# Arduino EMF Detector 

This repository contains code to program a Arduino Uno microcontroller to detect the strength of electromagnetic radiations emitted by various household appliances. The code was written in Arduino IDE.

The microcontroller uses 
1. A long wire as an antenna to detect presence of EM radiation.
2. 3 1M Î© resistors to detect the strrength of the radations.
3. 10 LEDs to indicate the magnitude of the radiations.
